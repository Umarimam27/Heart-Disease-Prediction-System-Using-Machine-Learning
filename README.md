# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This project is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters. It leverages a Random Forest classifier trained on medical data, combined with feature scaling, to deliver accurate predictions through a simple and interactive web interface.
